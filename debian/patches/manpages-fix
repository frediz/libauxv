 .Sh RATIONALE
 The functionality in Libauxv was originally proposed for inclusion in GLIBC
 but was rejected by the maintainer.
-
+.Pp
 The reason this library is necessary is as follows:
-
+.Pp
 1.) GLIBC won't provide access to the 5th process variable, which is the
 auxiliary vector (see the link above).
-
+.Pp
 2.) Libraries may need access to the auxv information but only 'main' can find
 it.
-
+.Pp
 3.) Libraries may try to find the auxv after the env, but as a library you
 can't guarantee that a user application hasn't mangled the environment.
-
+.Pp
 4.) Given that the most reliable method for querying the aux vector is through
 /proc/self/auxv a reusable library is useful.
-
+.Pp
 5.) There is an automatic fallback to attempting to read the aux vector from
 the env if the /proc/self/auxv isn't supported by the kernel.
